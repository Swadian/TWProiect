        <p> King Crimson is one of prog rock's most acclaimed bands, having a sizeable cult following and influencing numerous other cultural acts, 
            both in music (Tool, Nirvana, ELP, Opeth, Haken, Enslaved, among others) as well as in literature (most notably, the antagonist of Stephen King's 
            magnum opus "the Dark Tower" is called The Crimson King).

        <p> The main creative mind behind KC is guitarist Robert Fripp, the only founding member who remained in the band throughout its activity. Their first album,
            "In the court of the Crimson King" is universally considered their best work, with "21st Century Schizoid Man" (linked below) being one of the 
        progenitors of the metal genre.  </p>
